Run compare_models to run WSB, Williams (WDB), and Beckstead's steady
burning model. This script is currently set up to solve for multiple
initial temperatures and pressures and determine ZN stability (type =
2) or Pressure Response (type = 1). Easily configured to compute other
sensitivities to compare. These models were written by Andrew Rettenmaier based upon some previous student work and published work describing each model.

figset.m is required to plot figures and was written by Travis Sippel.
